# Second Highest Salary [FAANG SQL Interview Question]

Imagine you're an HR analyst at a tech company tasked with analyzing employee salaries. Your manager is keen on understanding the pay distribution and asks you to determine the second highest salary among all employees.

It's possible that multiple employees may share the same second highest salary. In case of duplicate, display the salary only once.

### **`employee` Schema:**

| column_name | type | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| employee_id | integer | The unique ID of the employee. |
| name | string | The name of the employee. |
| salary | integer | The salary of the employee. |
| department_id | integer | The department ID of the employee. |
| manager_id | integer | The manager ID of the employee. |

### **`employee` Example Input:**

| employee_id | name | salary | department_id | manager_id |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Emma Thompson | 3800 | 1 | 6 |
| 2 | Daniel Rodriguez | 2230 | 1 | 7 |
| 3 | Olivia Smith | 2000 | 1 | 8 |

### **Example Output:**

second_highest_salary

---

2230

---

The output represents the second highest salary among all employees. In this case, the second highest salary is $2,230.

### **Submissions:**

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
  SELECT
    employee_id,
    salary,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank_salary
  FROM employee
)

SELECT salary AS second_highest_salary
FROM CTE
WHERE rank_salary = 2;
