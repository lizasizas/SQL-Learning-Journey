Assume you're given a table containing information on Facebook user actions. Write a query to obtain number of monthly active users (MAUs) in July 2022, including the month in numerical format "1, 2, 3".

Hint:

- An active user is defined as a user who has performed actions such as 'sign-in', 'like', or 'comment' in both the current month and the previous month.

### **`user_actions` Table:**

| **Column Name** | **Type** |
| --- | --- |
| user_id | integer |
| event_id | integer |
| event_type | string ("sign-in, "like", "comment") |
| event_date | datetime |

### **`user_actions`Example Input:**

| **user_id** | **event_id** | **event_type** | **event_date** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 445 | 7765 | sign-in | 05/31/2022 12:00:00 |
| 742 | 6458 | sign-in | 06/03/2022 12:00:00 |
| 445 | 3634 | like | 06/05/2022 12:00:00 |
| 742 | 1374 | comment | 06/05/2022 12:00:00 |
| 648 | 3124 | like | 06/18/2022 12:00:00 |

### **Example Output for June 2022:**

| **month** | **monthly_active_users** |
| --- | --- |
| 6 | 1 |

### **Example**

In June 2022, there was only one monthly active user (MAU) with the **`user_id`** 445.

Please note that the output provided is for June 2022 as the **`user_actions`** table only contains event dates for that month. You should adapt the solution accordingly for July 2022.

### **Submission:**

```sql
WITH juni AS (
  SELECT user_id AS user_id_juni, event_type,
    DATE_PART('month', event_date) AS part_month
  FROM user_actions
  WHERE DATE_PART('month', event_date) = 6
),

july AS (
  SELECT user_id AS user_id_july, event_type,
    DATE_PART('month', event_date) AS part_month
  FROM user_actions
  WHERE DATE_PART('month', event_date) = 7
)

SELECT
  part_month AS month,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id_july) AS monthly_active_users
FROM july
WHERE user_id_july IN (SELECT user_id_juni FROM juni)
GROUP BY part_month;
```

### **Another Solution:**

```sql
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM curr_month.event_date) AS mth, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT curr_month.user_id) AS monthly_active_users 
FROM user_actions AS curr_month
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT last_month.user_id 
  FROM user_actions AS last_month
  WHERE last_month.user_id = curr_month.user_id
    AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM last_month.event_date) =
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM curr_month.event_date - interval '1 month')
)
  AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM curr_month.event_date) = 7
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM curr_month.event_date) = 2022
GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM curr_month.event_date);
```
